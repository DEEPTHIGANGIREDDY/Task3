    <h1><ins>Mahābhārata</ins></h1>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata_(disambiguation)"><b>Mahābhārata</b></a> (/məˌhɑːˈbɑːrətə, ˌmɑːhə-/ mə-HAH-BAR-ə-tə, MAH-hə-;[1][2][3][4] Sanskrit: महाभारतम्, Mahābhāratam, pronounced [mɐɦaːˈbʱaːrɐt̪ɐm]) is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India revered in Hinduism, the other being the Rāmāyaṇa.[5] 
        It narrates the events and aftermath of the Kurukshetra War, a war of succession between two groups of princely cousins, the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas.
    </p>
        <br>
<mark>It also contains philosophical and devotional material</mark>, such as a discussion of the four "goals of life" or puruṣārtha <sub> (12.161)</sub>. Among the principal works and stories in the Mahābhārata are the Bhagavad Gita, the story of Damayanti, the story of Shakuntala, 
the story of Pururava and Urvashi, the story of Savitri and Satyavan, the story of Kacha and Devayani, the story of Rishyasringa and an abbreviated version of the Rāmāyaṇa, often considered as works in their own right.

Traditionally, the authorship of the <strong>Mahābhārata</strong> is attributed to Vyāsa. There have been many attempts to unravel its historical growth and compositional layers. 
The bulk of the Mahābhārata was probably compiled between the 3rd century
 BCE and the 3rd century CE, with the oldest preserved parts not much older than around 400 BCE.[6][7] The text probably reached its final form by the early Gupta period (c. 4th century CE).[8][9]

<p>
    The <abbr title="Mahābhārata">Bhagavthgeeta</abbr> is the longest epic poem known and has been described as "the longest poem ever written".[10][11] Its longest version consists of over 100,000 śloka or over 200,000 individual verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), and long prose passages. At about 1.8 million words in total, 
    the Mahābhārata is roughly ten times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined, 
    or about four times the length of the Rāmāyaṇa.[12][13] W. J. Johnson has compared the importance of the Mahābhārata in the context of world civilization to that of the Bible, the Quran, the works of Homer, Greek drama, or the works of William Shakespeare.[14] Within the 
    Indian tradition it is sometimes called the fifth Veda. <sup>[15]</sup>
</p>

    The title is translated as "Great Bharat (India)," or "the story of the great descendents of Bharata."[16][17]



<p>
    The epic is traditionally ascribed to the sage Vyāsa, who is also a major character in the epic. Vyāsa described it as being itihāsa (transl. history). 
He also describes the Guru–shishya tradition, which traces all great teachers and their students of the Vedic times.

</p>
<p>
    The first section of the Mahābhārata states that it was Ganesha who wrote down the text to Vyasa's dictation, but this is regarded by scholars as a later interpolation to the epic
 and the "Critical Edition" doesn't include Ganesha at all.[18]

</p>


<p>
    The epic employs the story within a story structure, otherwise known as frametales, popular in many Indian religious and non-religious works. It is first recited at Takshashila by the sage Vaiśampāyana,[19][20] a disciple of Vyāsa, 
to the King Janamejaya who was the great-grandson of the Pāṇḍava prince Arjuna. The story is then recited again by a professional storyteller named Ugraśrava Sauti, many years later, to an assemblage of sages performing the 12-year sacrifice for the king Saunaka Kulapati in the Naimiśa Forest.

    Sauti recites the slokas of the Mahabharata.
The text was described by some early 20th-century Indologists as unstructured and chaotic. Hermann Oldenberg supposed that the original poem must once have carried an immense "tragic force" but dismissed the full text as a "horrible chaos."[21]
 Moritz Winternitz (Geschichte der indischen Literatur 1909) considered that "only unpoetical theologists and clumsy scribes" could have lumped the parts of disparate origin into an unordered whole.[22]
